The gazetteer information in the cities1 file, which was used to build
the testxml.data file is VERY inaccurate and includes only a few
cities for each country. The coordinates are often completely wrong
(placing some cities in the middle of the ocean, for example). Some of
them, however have been hand corrected from the Alexandria Gazetteer,
so that they are as accurate as possible.

The bounding boxes in the testxml.data file are also very inaccurate,
because they were automatically generated from information in the
cities1 file by taking the Northernmost, Southernmost, Westernmost and
Easternmost points from any CITY coordinate to form the bounding box.

Also note that the WDB data used to draw the map is also old
(pre-1988) and includes a divided Germany as well as a single
Yugoslavia and "USSR" instead of the new balkan countries and
independent Russian republics.

In addition please note that the map data is dependent on machine architecture. If
you get garbage or error messages about the data, there is a simple program 
(wdb.convert.c) that can be built to convert to the opposite 'endian' structure.

Build the program using...

gcc -o wdbconvert wdbconvert.c

then run it as...

wdbconvert map.data newmap.data
