CLIENT TODO LIST "*" = todo "+" = fixed "-" = changed

* Make sure everything works with the tcl client code -- pretty good so far...

* Search/Display/Use Explain records

* Search/Display/Use Generic records

* Add result-set deletion support

* add Browse facility

* add Sort facility & language

* add Access control facility

* Close facility 

* Additional parsing options for full-text (e.g. un-wrap split hyphenated
words at end of line -- eliminate scanning junk, etc.)

+ Multiple simultaneous connections (changed zclose, tk_connect and others)

+ Keep result set numbering straight (server doc numbers now included in 
  DOCUMENT structure, other things fixed too.

- Handle selection of things out of order (eliminated caching on the client
  side -- it was too wasteful of space, and the server handles things fine
  for out-of-order present requests. Caching can be handled at higher level 
  (Tcl) if desired anyhow.)

+ Really need more elegant solution for multiple attributes sets in queries.
  (There is now a single attribute table with a bitwise ORed attribute set
   ID for all supported attribute sets -- permits clean handling of 
   "superset" attribute sets like GILS and STAS.)

+ Some old code -- loadcheshcmds.c and marc2list.c
  has been removed because the functionality is provided now by
  z_format.c

+ Result set list position should be reset on each new search
  re-verify all the position numbers, etc.

+ There should be a "default session" structure that can be set and
  looked at BEFORE a connection is made -- need to be able to control
  variables for the INIT interaction. -- Fixed by adding a TMP session
  structure that is used to perform the basic initialization of any
  session that comes after one of it's values are set.

+ parsing error or search failure for call number searching -- turned out
  to be an odd bug (or offset problems) in the parser -- the attributetype
  for the structure attribute was being set to 0 -- this was happening
  on anything without a structure type of 6 so it led to several problems
  in searching some indexes. Should be OK now...

+ character normalization seems to work OK for SGML from cheshire,
  but NOT for MARC records from MELVYL or elsewhere -- something
  strange... Turned out to be a parameter int subfcopy that removed
  all non-ascii characters.

- Make the HOSTs table a loaded table from some (setable) default location
  via Tcl. --- Hosts CAN be load from TCL and remain in the table for the
  duration of the session. The "default" hosts are just a useful set.

- Mechanism for adding attributes from Tcl -- given that the attributes
  are set in stone via the standards process it is probably best to
  just build them in as needed.
