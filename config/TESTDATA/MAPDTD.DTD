<!-- This is a DTD for documents composed of multiple non-sgml files
     the contents of each "PART" definition are used to retrieve
     and extract the appropriate portions of the document using
     pathnames (which may be relative to the path designated in the PATH
     attribute. 
     At a minimum each record has  a main tag called "docinfo" which has
     a required "id" number attribute, and optional alternative id "altid"
     and a "path" attribute that shows the full root path shared by all
     parts of the document. If not supplied it will be assumed that
     complete paths are used for each part defined.
     All other tags are called "part" and the data surrounded by
     the tag should consist of a filename only. There are two attributes
     used with each part. The first is a "TAG" which is treated by the
     indexing routines as if it were the SGML tag for this part. The "TAG"
     attribute is required. The second is PATTERN. PATTERN is used as a 
     regular expression to extract the indexable portion of the named file -->
