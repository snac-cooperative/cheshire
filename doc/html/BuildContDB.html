<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<P><B>BuildContDB</B> <I> </I>
</P>

<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P>
BuildContDB is a utility program for creating BerkeleyDB file that contains an indexed version of the FILECONT data (see configfiles documentation).
This was created because some databases have very large numbers of
records, each of which is a single file in a file tree, and thus there is
a single filecont entry for each of them. DB= should be omitted from
conventional filecont entries. The utility programs BuildContDB and DumpContDB
are included to create and display filecont databases. A filedef using this
would include something like:
<BR>
  &lt;FILENAME&gt; DATA/en &lt;/FILENAME&gt;
  <BR>
  &lt;FILECONT ID=0 MIN=0 MAX=0 DB=1&gt;DATA/en.cont_DB&lt;/FILECONT&gt;
  <BR>
  the filecont data is usually built using buildassoc before being indexed by
  BuildContDB.

<P>
Syntax: <BR>
BuildContDB {-q} CONTFILENAME DBENV_DIR
<P>
Where the CONTFILENAME is the name of a contfile created by -r option of
buildassoc (or by hand if desired) and the DBENV_DIR is the DBENV
directory BerkeleyDB should use while building the index.

<H2>Related Programs </H2>
<P>
There is also a utility to dump the contents of the index: <BR>
DumpContDB CONTFILEDBNAME DBENV_DIR <BR>
This takes the pathname of the index created by BuildContDB and a DBENV
directory to use, and dumps the contents of the index.


<H2>BUGS </H2>

<P> The program tends to create the DB in DBENV directory. But it can
be moved to whereever it is wanted.</P>
