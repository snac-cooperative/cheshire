<hr WIDTH="100%"><font color="#FF0000">Cheshire II - Windows NT/2000 Binary
Distribution</font></h1></center>
This is the Windows NT binary distribution of the Cheshire II information
retrieval system. This version is very much based on the Unix versions
of the system with Windows specific behavior and workarounds added for
NT and 2000 functionality -- It should work OK with XP as well, though this
hasn't been tested (and thing will be in different places). This distribution doesn't include a few of the various
programs in the full Unix distribution, because many of them are not important
or useful in the windows environment, however most of unix programs now have NT/2000 versions as well.
<p>Note that Tcl and Tk 8.3.2 (the current distribution should work also)
should be installed on the system intending to run these programs in the
default locations (C:\Program Files\Tcl\...). The Tcl/Tk distribution is
included as a self extracting archive (TCL832.exe).
<p>The programs here are all intended to be run from the command line
(with a couple of exceptions -- the cheshire2 and staffcheshire clients).
They can also be run from the "Run" box in the Start menu. In order to run
the programs from the command line, the system
PATH environment variable <b>MUST</b> be updated to include the location
of these programs (especially the zserver_fork program). To do this open
the system control panel item and select the environment tab (or in Win2000
select the Advanced tab and then the Environment Variables button). In the System
Variables box select "Path" and append a semicolon and the full path name
of the folder where the programs are located, then press the "set", "Apply",
and "OK" buttons in that order (or just the OK buttons in Win2000).
<p>Note that starting with version 2.20 the system now needs to have a
DATABASE ENVIRONMENT area set aside for use by BerkeleyDB for handling
locking and disk-backed buffering of data. The advantage gained by these
changes is that it should is now safe to run index-building updates while
the server is actively searching the same database. The database environment
should be set up as an empty directory accessible to the server. The same
database environment may be shared among all of the databases accessed
by a server. You tell the system where the database environment area is
located in one of two ways:
<p>1) Set the environment variable <b>CHESHIRE_DB_HOME</b> to the full
pathname of the database environment directory.
<br><b>OR</b>
<br>2) Add a &lt;DBENV> tag immediately after the &lt;DBCONFIG> and before
the first &lt;FILEDEF> in the configuration file.
<p>The environment variable has priority and will override the DBENV tag
in a config file.
<p>IF neither of these is done, the server or program (such as index_cheshire,
zserver, webcheshire, etc.) will quit with the message "CHESHIRE_DB_HOME
must be set OR config file &lt;DBENV> set." sent to the console or to the
server log file.
<p>When indexing is run (actually when any program that accesses or updates
the indexes is run) Three files are created in the database environment
directory, (__db.001, __db.002, and __db.004). Any program or user who
accesses the database must be able to read and write these files. The simplest
way to handle this is to make the files world read and writable. Alternatively
group write could be used, with all users allowed to update and access
the database -- including the user ids associated with the inetd-started
servers -- as members.
<p>All of the programs usually require some command line arguments. The
basic form of the command can be seen by typing the command name alone
and pressing return. Further documentation on the system and programs can
be found in the "Doc" directory and their descriptions are linked below.
The programs and files included in this distribution are:
<p><b><a href="buildassoc.html">buildassoc</a></b> -- used to build
direct access mapping files for SGML data.
<p><b><a href="cheshire2.html">Cheshire2</a></b><a href="cheshire2.html">
</a>-- The Tcl/Tk scriptable client program (example scripts may be found
in the GUI and Scripts folders -- To run them, cd to that folder and type "cheshire2
opac", which runs the "opac" script in that folder giving a graphical search
interface. Typing "cheshire2" alone opens a console for interactive use
of the client. 
Scripts may also be dragged and dropped on the Cheshire2 icon. Staffcheshire is
another version of the same program (including local database access commands
like webcheshire).
<p><b>webcheshire</b> -- Client program, like above, but without a graphical
window. This is intended to be used for CGI scripting for web services. The 
commands for this client are also documented in the 
<a href="cheshire2.html">Cheshire2</a> client documentation.
<p><b>CountDB</b> -- Produces counts of items in indexes.
<br><b>DTD_Parser</b> -- Test parses and dumps an SGML/XML dtd -- reporting
problems.
<br><b>DumpDB</b> -- Display the items in an index.
<BR><B>DumpPost</b> -- Display
the items and internal document numbers for each occurrence of an item
in an index.
<br><b>DumpProx</b> -- Display the items, document numbers, and term locations
for terms in proximity indexes.
<br><b>HighPost</b> -- Show only the items in an index that occur more
than a certain number of times
<p>All of these program are primarily for examining the database for maintenance
and evaluation. To see the arguments required for each of these programs,
just enter its name on the command line with no arguments.
<p><b><a href="jserver.html">Jserver</a> </b>-- Direct port server
program for providing access to databases based on <a href="configfiles.html">configuration
files</a> and a server initialization file. This is an alternative form
of Server for use on NT. When it is run from the command line it waits
for a connection on the port supplied as a command line argument and, when
a connection arrives it spawns a copy of itself to continue listening on
the port, and proceeds to process the connection. Note that once this is
started running there will continue to be a jserver listening on the named
port until it is either killed using the NT Process manager, or the system
is rebooted. See the document linked above for the format of queries and
responses to jserver.
<p><b><a href="index_cheshire.html">Index_cheshire</a> </b>-- Indexing
program for creating databases based on <a href="configfiles.html">configuration
files</a>.
<p><b><a href="index_clusters.html">Index_clusters</a></b> -- Cluster
building and indexing for appropriately set up <a href="configfiles.html">configuration
files</a>.
<p><b>Parser</b> This program parses SGML/XML records based on a <a href="configfiles.html">configuration
file</a> and dumps a form of the record to stdout.
<p><b>Tstsearch </b>-- a test program for local searching (without the
server or client connections).
<p><b>Test_Config</b> -- a test program for checking the validity of configuration
files. Reports on the contents of the file if successfully parsed.
<p><b>TestParse</b> -- a test program to check search command syntax (see&nbsp;
<a href="cheshire2.html#zfind">Cheshire 2 documentation</a> on zfind
for search command syntax). Note that the initial "zfind" is not used in
this test program.
<p><b><a href="zserver_fork.html">Zserver_fork</a></b> -- This is the
primary Z39.50 Server for regular use on NT. When it is run from the command
line it waits for a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
connection on the port supplied as a command line argument and, when a
connection arrives it spawns a copy of itself
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to continue listening on the port, and proceeds to process the connection.
Note that once this is started running there
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
will continue to be a zserver listening on the named port until it is either
killed using the NT Process manager, or the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
system is rebooted.
<p><b><a href="zserver_nt.html">Zserver_NT </a></b>-- This is a test
version of the Zserver that only runs for a single connection, and then
exits without spawning other
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
processes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Test_files folder contains some sample files and indexes created
with Index_cheshire using the <a href="Test_files/testconfig.new">testconfig.new
configuration file.</a>
<br>The contents of configuration files are described here. To test the
indexing program you should delete all of the "dictionary..." files
<br>(these are the indexes) and edit the testconfig.new file so that all
of the path names (currently&nbsp; "D:\Cheshire_bin\Test_files\...")
<br>point to where the Test_files directory actually is on your system.
Then run the index_cheshire program in that directory, e.g.:
<br>"index_cheshire -b testconfig.new" -- Messages will be sent to a file
called "INDEX_LOGFILE" in the same directory.
<P>
Additional command information can be found in the Unix documentation
included in the doc directory -- html documents are available from the
<a href="doc_index.html">Main documents page</a>.
