<h2> <font color="#0000FF">Bitmapped Indexes</font></h2> <p>\- Use and
operation of Bitmapped Indexes <h2> <font
color="#0000FF">DESCRIPTION</font></h2> 
This document describes
CheshireII Bitmapped Indexes, used to index data that has very large
numbers of records with a small number of unique values. Bitmapped
indexes use only a single bit to represent the occurrence of a value
in a record. They are primarily intended to be used to limit results
to those with one of the values. They do not require instantiation of
entire resultsets, and actual record mapping data is only accessed as
needed.  
<p> 
<hr> 
<h2> <font color="#0000FF">Bitmapped Indexes</font></h2> 

<p> The most obvious difference between normal CheshireII indexes and
a bitmapped indexes is that bitmapped indexes store no frequency data
about the items that they index and thus can only provide boolean
results. Since the primary intent to to provide fast access to items
with very large numbers (i.e. millions) of records but only a very few
values shared by most of the records (for example in a database of
millions of records of personal information "gender" might have 
million of occurrences of "M" and of "F"). In conventional indexes 
list of each record number containing each value have to be maintained
meaning that the index must typically chain together hundreds of thousands
of data blocks to contain these lists. In a BITMAPPED index
only a single bit is stored for (potentially) each record in the
database, instead of the 64 bits per entry stored in conventional
indexes.
<P>
Bitmapped indexes are optimal for very common elements with a few
values, and will typically have an order of magnitude reduction in the
size of the stored index and an order of magnitude increase in the
speed of retrieval (either when retrieving all items with one of the
values, or for using Boolean AND or Boolean NOT to restrict a result
set to only items with one of the values. Boolean OR, however will
have no particular speed advantage over a conventional
index. Bitmapped indexes should not be used for keywords extracted
from text fields, in fact it is recommended that the EXTRACT=EXACTKEY
be used, if possible, for the most efficient indexing and retrieval.
The EXTRACT=KEYWORD attribute may be used, but if a search key translates
to multiple values in the index, there is some loss of efficiency (but
it may still be faster than a conventional index).
<P>
Bitmapped indexes and indexing are specified in the configuration file
by setting the ACCESS attribute to "BITMAPPED" in the INDEXDEF tag for
the index you wish to make a bitmap. Bitmap indexes can ONLY be used
for Boolean retrieval, and they are specifically designed to speed up
access time on indexes that have only a few values (such as an
attribute that appears in every record of the database and has only 3
or possible values), and a very large number of records (i.e.,
hundreds of thousands or millions of records). 
<P>
Included in the index directory is a utility to convert from a conventional
index to a bitmapped index. This utility is called convert2bitmap and it
will be automatically built and put into the bin directory in the normal
building process for the distribution. The program is used by the command:
<P>
convert2bitmap configfile in_mainfile_name in_index_name out_index_pathname
<P>
That is, the arguments are the configfile of the database containing
the conventional index to be converted, the name (FILETAG) of the main
file in that configfile, and the name (INDXTAG) of that index. The
last argument is a full pathname of the new bitmap index to be created
(it doesn't need an entry in the specified configfile). Once the new
bitmapped index is created this pathname is used as the INDXNAME for
the new index (which should have EXTRACT and NORMAL attributes and
other INDEXDEF components the same as the conventional index, but with
the ACCESS type of BITMAPPED (you will need a different name and tag
for the new index if you are keeping the conventional index in place).

<h2> <font color="#0000FF">Implementation Details Bitmapped Indexes</font></h2>

Much of the work with bitmapped indexes is done using a set of bit
manipulation macros in header/bitmap.h. In a bitmap index the data is
divided into blocks of 8192 bytes (8K), thus each block has storage
for 65536 records, The position of a bit in a block represents a
record ID. Thus, in the first data block of a bitmapped index records
1-65536 are represented in the second data block records 65537-131072
are represented, etc. 8k blocks are used because that is internal
blocksize for BerkeleyDB files, and therefore is handled most
efficiently.

<P>
Here are the bitmap macros defined in bitmap.h:

The above macros are used to manipulate the bitmap blocks and set and
clear bits representing the occurrence of a particular value in a
particular record. In the index itself two kinds of items are stored.
The first is a conventional entry for each unique value of the items
being indexed this uses the value itself as the index key and contains
the term id number and the total number of records containing the
value. The second kind of item in the index has a single data block
representing 65536 record ids. These are stored separately using a
bitblock key (defined as short integer blockid, and an integer
termid).  The blockid represents the first record number of the block
(minus 1) shifted right 16 bits. The macro bitblock_id() above is used
to determine which bitblock contains a given record id. The
combination of the blockid and termid is used as the key for a data
block.  <P> In searching a bitblock index, the search key is used to
locate the matching record (first kind as above) which provides the
termid to use in locating and retrieving the second kind of record as
needed for the operations being performed. Additional shortcuts are
taken in using bitmaps within a boolean AND or NOT with a conventional
resultset, and only those data blocks containing record numbers that
occur in the conventional resultset are actually fetched and tested
(using the bitmap_test macro above). When a search is performed on a
bitmap index alone, the full resultset is not instantiated, and blocks
representing particular records are only retrieved as they are needed
by present or search display operations.
