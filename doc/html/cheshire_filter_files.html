<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<P><B>cheshire_file_filter</B> <I> assocfilename contfilename pattern</I>
</P>

<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P> Cheshire_file_filter prevents the indexing work done with index_cheshire based on comparing the file name with the regular expression pattern included as the third argument. Any
SGML/XML record included in the filenames matching the pattern are "deleted" by marking it in the associator file, no
actual physical deletion of the record is performed. Note that
"deleted" records may be re-instated by running the program again with the same
pattern. Also note that this program requires both an associator file and
a continuation file (i.e., the buildassoc program has been run with the -r option to build an external .cont file of the individual files making up the database.</P>
