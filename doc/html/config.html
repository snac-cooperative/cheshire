      This document aims to aid in configuring the Cheshire2 search engine by hand, in conjunction with the <a href = "docs/configfiles.html">technical documentation</a>.  A sample configuration file is available <a href = "config-sample.html">here</a>.  It assumes that the cheshire installation is as described in the <a href = "setup.html">setup</a> file.
    <p>
      Before continuing, please be aware that there is an excellent graphical tool available in order to configure and maintain the configuration files. This is (currently) in the source code for cheshire, in the directory 'config-gui'.  To start it, chmod 'sc.tcl' to 755 and run it.
    <p>
      The configuration for each Cheshire database is in the form of an SGML document. It has the basic structure as shown in the <a href = "tree.html">tree</a> page.  Have a look at this, as we'll be stepping through it bit by bit.
    <p>      As there is a lot to know about the configuration file, the information is split up into sections about the various sections.
    <ul>
      <li><a href = "config-file.html">Main File Definition</a>
		    <li><a href = "config-explain.html">Explain Definition</a>
      <li><a href = "config-index.html">Index Definition</a>
      <li><a href = "config-component.html">Component Definition</a>
      <li><a href = "config-cluster.html">Cluster Definition</a>
