<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<P><B>index_cheshire</B> <I>[-b -T tempdirname -S "sort flags" -L logfilename] configfilename [startrec] [maxrec]</I>
</P>

<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P> Index_cheshire uses the description included in the configuration file
<I>configfilename</I> to index an SGML database. </P>

<P> The configuration file should describe the main SGML data file, the
associator file (See <B>buildassoc</B>), the DTD for the SGML data, and
the desired index and cluster definitions. The program will create the
index files specified in the configuration file and then process all of
the SGML records and extract the appropriate information to populate the
specified indexes. It will also extract the base information used for cluster
files (which must be further processed by <B>index_clusters</B> to create
the full cluster indexes. </P>

<P> If the <I>-b</I> flag is used, the indexing uses some batch loading
techniques that greatly increase the indexing speed. Use of this flag is
recommended in most cases, and especially when doing the initial indexing
of a large database. If the -T flag is used then
the "tempdirname" should be the path of the directory where the temporary
files created by the batch processing and sorting are to be put. The
-S flag can be used to pass a quoted list of flags to the system sort
used in batch loading (see the documentation for the sort command on
your system for the flags available).</P>

<P> The optional <I>startrec</I> and <I>maxrec</I> arguments are the logical
record numbers of the first record to start indexing and the last record
to index. If these are not supplied, index_cheshire assumes that all records
should be indexed. If a single number is supplied it is assumed to be the
<I>startrec</I> parameter, and indexing will be done from that record to
the end of file. Note that the logical record numbers used are derived
from the associator file for the database and usually correspond to the
sequence of records in the SGML file. .</P>

<H2>ADDING RECORDS TO A DATABASE </H2>

<P> New SGML records can simply be concatenated to the end of an SGML file,
but they then must be added to the indexes. To do this, after concatenating
the new records, run the <I>buildassoc</I> command on the database -- this
will report the logical record number for the start of the new records
in the database. This number should then be supplied as the <I>startrec</I>
parameter to the <B>index_cheshire</B> program. </P>

<H2>LOG and ERROR INFORMATION </H2>

<P> If the "-L" option is not used, then running the
<B>index_cheshire</B> program creates a file in the current directory
called INDEX_LOGFILE. If the "-L" option is used then the logfile is
given the name provided on the command line. If this file already
exists when the program is run, new information is appended to the
existing file. INDEX_LOGFILE will contain any errors or problems
encountered in indexing. </P>
