<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>
<B>index_clusters</B> <I>[-b -T tempfiledir -S "sort flags" -L logfilename] configfilename [INDEXONLY]</I>


<P><H2> DESCRIPTION</H2> 
<P>
Index_clusters uses the descriptions included in the configuration
file <I>configfilename</I> to index the cluster files of a
Cheshire II database. 
<P>
The configuration file should describe the main SGML data file,
the cluster data files,
the associator file (See <B>buildassoc</B>), the DTDs for the 
main SGML data file and the cluster files, 
and the desired index and cluster definitions. This program will
create the index files specified in the configuration file for
the cluster files (that is only those with the FILEDEF tag
<FILEDEF TYPE=CLUSTER>)
It will use the base temporary information used for the cluster files (which
must be created by <B>index_cheshire</B> based on the <CLUSTER> definition
in the main file definition).
<P>
If the <I>-b</I> flag is used, the indexing uses some batch loading
techniques that greatly increase the indexing speed. Use of this
flag is recommended in most cases, and especially when doing the
initial indexing of a large database. If the -T flag is used then
the "tempdirname" should be the path of the directory where the temporary
files created by the batch processing and sorting are to be put.
The -S flag can be used to pass a quoted list of flags to the system sort
used in batch loading (see the documentation for the sort command on
your system for the flags available).<P>

The optional <I>INDEXONLY</I> keyword is used to do only
the indexing of the cluster files, and not to generate
the cluster files themselves from the temporary base cluster
data created by <B>index_cheshire</B>. This option is provided for
cases where indexing must be re-run and the cluster files have
already been created.

<P><H2> LOG and ERROR INFORMATION</H2>

<P> If the "-L" option is not used, then running the
<B>index_cheshire</B> program creates a file in the current directory
called INDEX_LOGFILE. If the "-L" option is used then the logfile is
given the name provided on the command line. If this file already
exists when the program is run, new information is appended to the
existing file. INDEX_LOGFILE will contain any errors or problems
encountered in indexing. </P>
