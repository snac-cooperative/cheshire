<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>
<B>jserver</B><I>[-p port] [-c server_init_file]</I>
.BE 

<P><H2> DESCRIPTION  </H2>
<P>
This command runs the Cheshire II search from the command line.
Normally the server will be set up to run via INETD and will be run
when users connect on its defined port. Running the server from the
command line is useful for testing and "debugging" database and
server configurations.
<P>
Once started the server waits for a tcp/ip connection from a user and
processes all commands described below from that user until the connection is
terminated. The server then cleans up and exits.

<P>
There are two arguments for this command:
<P>
The <I>-p</I> argument provides a port
number for incoming connections. This is overridden by INETD, but it
overrides the PORT parameter in the initialization file (see below).
<P>
The <I>-c</I> argument provides the name of a server init file. If
not supplied the server tries to read a file called "server.init"
in the current directory.


<P><H2> INETD SERVER SETUP </H2>

Server setup to run under inetd will 
require root access to modify some systems file.

A line like the following should be added to the /etc/services file,
(the 2222 can be any port you want)

<PRE>
jcheshire        2222/tcp        ir      # Cheshire II server
</PRE>

Then a line like the following should be added to /etc/inetd.conf (note
that this should be a single line, even though it wraps here):

<PRE>
#
# Non-Z39.50 Information Retrieval access...
#
jcheshire        stream  tcp     nowait  nobody  /usr/local/bin/jserver 
jserver -c /usr/test/data/server.init
#
</PRE>

This means that when the "jcheshire service" on port 2222 is connected to,
it will start up a session as user "nobody" using the program at
/usr/local/bin/jserver

The arguments passed to the zserver are what remains on the line above:
jserver -c /usr/test/data/server.init

This is argv[0] -- the program name -- argv[1] -- "-c" a flag indicating 
that the following argument is the name of the initialization file for
the server.

<P><H2> JSERVER INIT FILE CONTENTS </H2>
<P>
The server initialization file contains a variety of information on
the configuration of the server, and the database files associated 
with the server. The jserver initialization file contents are identical
to the zserver initialization file contents (see the zserver man page).
However, with the jserver only the first named database and configuration
file are used.

<P><H2>JSERVER CONNECTIONS AND COMMAND LANGUAGE</H2>
<P>
When a client connects to the server on the correct port a simple ascii
command language is used to interact with the search engine. This 
command language doesn't allow the richness of interaction that is
available with a Z39.50 connection, but it does permit search and retrieval
from the database.
<P>
Each command sent to the server is an ascii string terminated by a newline.
The first word of the command may be truncated to a single letter (eg, "f"
for find). The responses returned from the server all consist of an
initial 8 byte string of ascii numeric characters (0-9) giving the length
of the rest of the message. If the result is an error message, the first
byte of the message will be an "E".
<P>

<HR>
<P><B>INIT {password}</B>
<P>
Initializes the server and prepares for searching. The result, if
successful is the word "OK", followed by the word "FILE" followed
by the filename or path. Passwords are not currently implemented.
<P>
for example:
<PRE>
init
00000053OK FILE /usr/users/ray/Work/ESSEX_TEST/codebook3.sgm
</PRE>

<HR>
<P><B>FIND </B><I>indexname1 [RELOP] search_string1 
[[BOOLOP] indexname2 [RELOP] search_string2 [BOOLOP2]... [resultsetid id_string]</I>
<P>
This command will search the current database specified on the
current host/server established by the zselect command.
<P>

<I>resultsetid id_string</I>                              (OPTIONAL)
<P>

This specifies a server-side set name (id_string) which will be used
for the storing the results of the current search. This will not work
unless the server supports named result sets. If omitted the result
set name used is "Default".
<P>

<I>indexname</I>
<P>

This can be any name in the BIB1, GILS, or EXP1 attribute sets. However,
the server-side database will need to be set up to create indexes for
the attributes desired (see the documentation on configuration files).
<P>

<I>RELOP</I>
<P>

The relational operation to be performed. This are:
<P>
   
blank | = : Searches for equal values to the search string.
<BR>
<= | LE | .LE. : Search for values less than or equal to the search string.
<BR>
< | LT | .LT. : Search for values less than the search string.
<BR>
> | GT | .GT. : Search for values greater than the search string.
<BR>
>= | GE | .GE. : Search for values greater than or equal to the search string.
<BR>
<> | != | NE | .NE. : Search for values NOT equal to the search string.
<BR>
? | PHON | .PHON. : Search for values phonetically similar to the search string.
<BR>
% | STEM | .STEM. : Search for stemmed values equal to the stemmed search string
.
<BR>
@ | REL | .REL. : Search for items relevant to the search string.
<P>

Note that most system do not support ?, % or @, and many support only
equal. The Cheshire server supports @ to indicate a probabilistic
ranked search should be performed.
<P>

<I>BOOLOP</I>
<P>

The Boolean operator to apply between results from different indexes.
these are:
<P>

AND | .AND. | && : Boolean AND
<BR>
OR | .OR. | || : Boolean OR
<BR>
NOT | .NOT. | ANDNOT | .ANDNOT. | !! : Boolean NOT
<P>

Note that parentheses may be used to group Boolean sub-expressions, for
example:
<BR>
find title gone and (title wind or title fishing) 
<P>
<I>search_string</I>
<P>

The term(s) to locate in the index. May include a truncation symbol (#).
Phrase searching within an index that supports proximity searching is
indicated by enclosing the phrase in dollar signs -- for example:

<p><B>find title $gone with the wind$</B></p>

The results of a successful search include the name of the result set
containing the search results followed by the number of records located
in the search.
<P>
For example:
<PRE>
find title england and any workers
00000010Default 3
</PRE>
<HR>
<B>DISPLAY</B> <I>resultsetid  start_records_num number_of_records display_format_name</I>
<P>
Display number_of_records records resulting from a search having the
specified resultsetid, and retrieve number_of_records starting at 
start_record_num in the result set.
<P>
<I>resultsetid</I>                        
<P>
This specifies the server result set name to use when retrieving a record.
<P>
<I>start_records_num</I>                     
<P>
The ordinal number of the position in the result set.
<P>
<I>number_of_records</I> 
<P>
The number of records that the client will try to retrieve from the result set.
<P>
<I>display_format_name</I> (optional)
<P>
The name of a &lt;DISPLAY&gt; format in the configuration file of the
database being searched. See the <A href=configfiles.html>configfile documentation</A> for description of the &lt;DISPLAY&gt; part of the config file.
If the format exists the server will apply the formatting conversion or
specification to the retrieved records, and return the formatted records.
Typically, this will be used with an &lt;EXCLUDE&gt; format that eliminates
unwanted parts of the SGML document. This argument is optional, if omitted
the display defaults to returning the full SGML records.
<P>
for example:
<PRE>
display default 1 3
00018036 00000003&lt;codebook&gt;&lt;stdyDscr&gt;
      &lt;citation&gt;
         &lt;titlStmt&gt;
            &lt;titl&gt;Working Members of the British House of Commons : England, 1691-1693&lt;/titl&gt;...
</PRE>
<P>
The result contains another 8 digit number following a space after the
length component. This number is the number of records retrieved and
included in the results.  The ascii character #30 (hex 0x1E, octal
036) separates each of the records sent back in the results from the
next record (there is no terminating character). The records are
returned in their raw SGML form.

<HR>
<B>CLOSE</B>
<P>
Close the connection. This command drops the connection and shuts down
the server.
<P>
Any other commands or garbage sent to the server will result in the
error message:
<BR>
00000019E Unknown command

<p>


<P><H2> OUTPUT FILES </H2>
<P>
A transaction log file is generated in the RESULT_SET_DIRECTORY with
the name defined in LOG_FILE_NAME. This will also contain system
error messages.

<P><H2> ERROR INFORMATION </H2>
<P>
It is not uncommon for server failure or indexing failure to be caused
by incorrect configuration files or server.init files. The first place to
look is in any log files (zserver.log) left in the RESULT_SET_DIRECTORY 
location. All error messages from the server are sent to the log file
(unless the server is started from the command line). If the server fails
before the log file is opened, the cause of the failure will be written
(if possible) to the file /tmp/templog.
