      <b>What is Cheshire?</b>
    <p>
      <i>This section is a (brief) summarised form of the document <a href = "http://cheshire.berkeley.edu/overview.html">http://cheshire.berkeley.edu/overview.html</a></i>
    <p>
      Cheshire is, at its heart, an SGML search engine. It supports full text documents, and many different types of query including relevance ranked, boolean and mixtures of the two. It can run in a server mode, and doing so uses the Z39.50 protocol, or via a CGI front end to be accessed from a web browser.
<br>
      It is open source, and freely available for use by academic or non commercial organisations. It is written and maintained  primarily by Ray Larson at UC Berkeley.
    <p>
