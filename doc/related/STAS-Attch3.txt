STAS Relationship Attributes

The STAS "Relationship" Attribute Type is assigned identifier = 2003.

The STAS "Relationship" Attribute Type is a distinct Attribute Type from the
bib-1 Relation Attribute.

The STAS "Relationship" Attribute may be used when performing a SCAN within
a thesaurus. The client may specify a "relationship code" as a Relationship
Attribute associated with the SCAN term to specify which subset of terms in
the thesaurus are to be presented.

STAS Relationship Attributes may also be applied to terms in a Search
Request.

Relationship codes can be used to find hierarchical/relational terms in the
thesaurus for a particular term. Relationship codes allow the client to
define very precisely what kinds of terms to look at or search for. For
instance, relationship codes can limit thesaurus terms to narrower terms or
related terms, to broader terms, to old or new terms, to preferred terms, or
to any combination of these.

A representative list of the STAS "Relationship" Attributes and their values
is specified in the following table. The authority list of the STAS
"Relationship" Attributes and their values is maintained separately.
