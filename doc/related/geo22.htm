<h2><a name="1. Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This document describes an application profile for the U.S. Federal Geographic Data
Committee's Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata <a href="#[1]">[1]</a> issued
in June 1994. This Geospatial Metadata Profile (GEO) is based on <em>ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1995
Information Retrieval(Z39.50): Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification</em>
<a href="#[2]">[2]</a>. The GEO Profile includes not only the specifications for Z39.50 in
the application but also other aspects of a GEO-conformant server that are outside the
scope of Z39.50. This Profile was written based on the specific examples and wording
provided by the Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service <a
href="#[3]">[3]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="2. Background">2. Background</a></h2>

<p>The Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata was developed by the Federal
Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and the ASTM Section D18.01.05 on Mapping and GIS to
provide a standard set of data element references for digital, geo-referenced spatial (or
&quot;geospatial&quot;) information. Metadata is data about the content, quality,
condition, and other characteristics of data. These standard tags for information elements
are intended to bridge implementation-specific labels used in existing geoprocessing
software and to facilitate discovery, query, retrieval, and presentation of geospatial
metadata -- and the spatial data they reference.</p>

<p>ASTM Section D18.01.05 started development of a standard for spatial metadata in August
1990 with input from participants at a workshop of the Urban and Regional Information
Systems Association in San Francisco, California. The Federal Geographic Data Committee
initiated work on the standard in June, 1992, through a forum on geospatial metadata. At
the forum, the participants agreed on the need for a standard on the information content
of metadata about geospatial data. The committee accepted the offer of ASTM Section
D18.01.05 to develop a draft information content standard. This draft was slightly
revised, and offered for public review from October 1992 to April 1993. Extensive comments
were received from the public. The FGDC's Standards Working Group revised the draft. The
revised draft was provided for further review and testing in July 1993. Refined drafts
were offered for review and testing in January and March 1994. The draft standard was
approved by the Federal Geographic Data Committee on June 8, 1994, and was referenced by
Executive Order 12906, &quot;Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access: The
National Spatial Data Infrastructure,&quot; signed on April 11, 1994, by President William
Clinton. Section 3, Development of a National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse, paragraph (b)
states: 

<ul>
  <p><em>&quot;Standardized Documentation of Data. Beginning 9 months from the date of this
  order, each agency shall document all new geospatial data it collects or produces, either
  directly or indirectly, using the standard under development by the FGDC, and make that
  standardized documentation electronically accessible to the Clearinghouse network. Within
  1 year of the date of this order, agencies shall adopt a schedule, developed in
  consultation with the FGDC, for documenting, to the extent practicable, geospatial data
  previously collected or produced, either directly or indirectly, and making that data
  documentation electronically accessible to the Clearinghouse network.&quot; </em></p>
</ul>

<p>This standard is the data documentation standard referenced in the executive order. The
ASTM version of this standard incorporates specific tag references for &quot;short
names&quot; and numeric tags for each data element or data element grouping <a href="#[4]">[4]</a>.
The short names are to be used as a guide to software implementors for internal tags for
tables, columns, or objects, and are suggested for use as tags in extensions to the
Standard Graphics Markup Language (SGML) and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to aid in
retrieval and presentation.</p>

<h2><a name="3. Scope">3. Scope</a></h2>

<p>The GEO Profile fully specifies the use of ANSI/NISO Z39.50. In addition, the GEO
Profile provides the specifications for the overall GEO application relating to the FGDC
Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata including other aspects of GEO-conformant
servers that are outside the scope of Z39.50. </p>

<p>The GEO Profile focuses on requirements for a GEO server operating in the Internet
environment. GEO clients will be able to interconnect with any GEO server, and these
clients will behave in a manner which allows interoperability with the GEO server. Clients
that support Z39.50 but do not implement the GEO Profile will be able to access FGDC
records with less than full GEO functionality.</p>

<p>The GEO Profile addresses intersystem interactions and information interchange but does
not specify user interface requirements. </p>

<h2><a name="4. Field of Application">4. Field of Application</a></h2>

<p>The GEO Profile supports search and retrieval of geospatial metadata entries and
related geospatial data sets accessible to GEO-compliant servers in the Internet
environment. This includes local applications of isolated TCP/IP networks, local area
networks based on Ethernet protocol, and wide-area networks using a consistent host
addressing scheme. The GEO Profile will be used by implementations of GEO server processes
as one method of providing standardized access to geospatial metadata and as a reference
to access the data they reference. It will also be used by client developers to understand
expected behaviors of GEO servers. A GEO server accessed using Z39.50 in the Internet
environment acts primarily as a direct access point to information stores it controls.
These information stores can be accessed through an API, such as is provided with the
ZDIST software from the Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval <a
href="#[5]">[5]</a>. The target information may be managed by operating system commands
against text files, by RDBMS or OODBMS against indexed data structures, or by
geoprocessing software systems which control spatial data and attribute information.</p>

<p>Data elements are also classified as Mandatory or Optional, although optionality is
dependent in several cases on the type of geospatial data being described. For example,
the number of rows and columns in a raster data set is not an applicable property for a
vector data set. Rows and columns would be mandatory for a raster data set and not
applicable (suppressed) for vector data set descriptions.</p>

<p>Some of the information resources pointed to by GEO Entries may be available
electronically through other communications protocols including the common Internet
protocols that facilitate electronic information transfer such as remote login (Telnet),
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and electronic mail (SMTP/MIME). The use of these protocols
or other communications paths is outside the scope of the GEO Profile.</p>

<p>Once connected to a GEO server, users supported by appropriate clients that understand
the GEO Profile may navigate through single or multiple servers. GEO servers will support
searching (i.e., accept a search query and return a result set or diagnostic messages) and
support browsing (i.e., accept a well-known search query and return a list of Entries in
brief display format). Although the GEO Profile addresses GEO servers only, it is
understood that clients have roles in the execution of these activities (e.g., browsing is
also a client function in the sense of how it interprets and presents GEO data).</p>

small, regional, continental, and global extent.</p>

<p><em><strong>(GEO) Entry</strong></em>: A collection of related metadata elements
associated with a single geospatial data object or product. Conceptually, this may equate
to a thematic data layer or map product, but may represent a collection of related themes
on one extreme, or a small set or instance of a spatial data object, such as a reservoir,
on the other. An Entry may include multiple values for a given element. </p>

<p><em><strong>Interoperability</strong></em>: A condition that exists when the
distinctions between information systems are not a barrier to accomplishing a task that
spans multiple systems.</p>

<p><em><strong>Mandatory</strong></em>: An element in a GEO Entry that must have a value
provided by the record source. The GEO Profile specifies which elements must be present
from the perspective of GEO servers.</p>

<p><em><strong>Origin</strong></em>: The part of a client application that initiates a
Z39.50 association and is the source of requests during the association.</p>

<p><em><strong>Profile</strong></em>: The statement of a function(s) and the environment
within which it is used, in terms of a set of one or more standards, and where applicable,
identification of chosen classes, subsets, options, and parameters of those standards. A
set of implementor agreements providing guidance in applying a standard interoperably in a
specific limited context.</p>

<p><em><strong>Registered Object</strong></em>: An object that is identified by a
name-to-thing relationship in which the name is recorded by a registration authority to
ensure that the names can be used unambiguously.</p>

application (i.e., a client). The application that includes the Z39.50 target. </p>

<p><em><strong>Target</strong></em>: The part of an server application that accepts a
Z39.50 association.</p>

<p><em><strong>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</strong></em>: A set of related standards
for encoding resource location and identification information for electronic and other
objects. Examples include Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and Uniform Resource Names
(URNs).</p>

<p><em><strong>USMARC</strong></em>: An implementation of ANSI/NISO Z39.2, the American
National Standard for Bibliographic Information Interchange <a href="#[6]">[6]</a>. The
USMARC format documents contain the definitions and content designators for the fields
that are to be carried in records structured according to Z39.2.</p>

<h2><a name="7. Z39.50 Specifications for GEO">7. Z39.50 Specifications for GEO</a></h2>

<p>This section details the required services available from Z39.50. It also describes an
Attribute Set for searching and Element Set Names for server presentation of results, and
prescribes the formal Record Syntaxes to be supported by GEO servers for the transfer of
Entries. </p>

<h3><a name="7.1. Version">7.1. Version</a></h3>

<p>At a minimum, GEO clients and servers must support Z39.50 Version 2 as specified in
Z39.50-1995. GEO requires support for the objects listed in section 7.2, some of which are
not defined in Z39.50-1995. No Version 3 services are required for implementation of the
GEO Profile.</p>

<h3><a name="7.2. GEO Objects">7.2. GEO Objects</a></h3>

<p>The following object identifier (OID) is assigned to the Z39.50 standard: 

<ul>
  <p>{iso (1) member-body (2) US (840) ANSI-standard-Z39.50 (10003)} </p>
</ul>

<p>This OID is abbreviated as: ANSI-standard-Z39.50.</p>

<p>Several object classes are assigned at the level immediately subordinate to
ANSI-standard-Z39.50, including: 

<ul>
  <li>3 = attribute set definitions </li>
  <li>4 = diagnostic definitions </li>
  <li>5 = record syntax definitions </li>
  <li>13 = database schema definitions. </li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="7.3. Communication Services">7.3. Communication Services</a></h3>

<p>When Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is used as the transport service, the
specification for use of TCP is found in <a href="#[7]">[7]</a>. The use of other
communication services is not yet defined.</p>

<h3><a name="7.4. Z39.50 Services">7.4. Z39.50 Services</a></h3>

<p>There are three Z39.50 (Version 2) services that are required for conformance: Init,
Search, and Present. No additional services are required for conformance to the GEO
Profile. Other Z39.50 services, however, may be provided optionally by servers and used by
clients. </p>

<p>Standard Z39.50 Init Service negotiation procedures control the use of all services. In
addition, GEO-conformant clients and servers must specify the implementation id, name, and
version within the Z39.50 Init Service.</p>

<h4><a name="7.4.1. Search">7.4.1. Search </a></h4>

<p>GEO clients and servers are required to support the Z39.50 Type-1 query. Support for
the Boolean operators AND, OR, and AND-NOT is also required. GEO servers should expect to
process queries consisting of Boolean combinations of textual, temporal, and spatial
search terms.</p>

<h5><a name="7.4.1.1. Attribute Set">7.4.1.1. Attribute Set</a></h5>

<p>The GEO Profile requires clients and servers to support the GEO Attribute Set. The GEO
Attribute Set is a registered object with an Attribute Set OID of {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 3
9}. GEO servers must also support the Bib-1 and GILS Attribute Sets to a limited extent.
That is, GEO servers must recognize the Bib-1 and GILS Attribute Sets to the extent that a
Bib-1 or GILS client may pass the Attribute Set OID in a query and a GEO server may
receive and process a query with the OID.</p>

<p>The GEO Attribute Set imports the Use, Structure, Relation, and Truncation Attribute
Types from the Bib-1 Attribute Set. In addition, the GEO Attribute Set imports selected
Attributes from the Bib-1 and GILS Attribute Sets, where the semantic meaning is
equivalent. Thus, search of GEO servers on common Bib-1 Attributes by clients familiar
with Bib-1 should be successful.</p>

<p>The GEO Profile defines additional Use, Structure, and Relation Attributes to
facilitate the searching of geographic and spatial information. Each Use Attribute defined
in the GEO Attribute Set corresponds in name and semantics to a record element of the GEO
Schema. See <a href="annex_a.htm">Annex A</a> for definitions of all GEO Attributes, and <a
href="annex_c.htm">Annex C</a> for the definition of the GEO Schema.</p>

<p>GEO servers are required to support a mandatory set of attribute combinations from the
GEO Attribute Set as specified in <a href="annex_b.htm">Annex B</a>. GEO servers are
required to recognize the attribute combination, and a search must always result in a
valid result set (which could contain zero records). GEO servers should never return any
of following Bib-1 diagnostics when a query includes the mandatory attribute combinations:

<ul>
  <li>Unsupported Attribute Type (113)</li>
  <li>Unsupported Use Attribute (114)</li>
  <li>Unsupported Relation Attribute (117)</li>
  <li>Unsupported Structure Attribute (118)</li>
  <li>Unsupported Attribute Combination (123)</li>
</ul>

<p>When a GEO server receives a query term containing attribute types, values, or
combinations that are not supported by the server, the server should fail the search
(search status = failure) and return an appropriate Bib-1 diagnostic. If other terms in
the query can be processed by the server, the server may also indicate that a subset of
search results is available (result set status = subset). A GEO server may, if appropriate
to its database, support additional attribute types, values, and combinations from the GEO
Attribute Set. See <a href="annex_a.htm">Annex A</a> for a list of the valid attribute
types and values, and <a href="annex_b.htm">Annex B</a> for a list of all valid attribute
combinations.</p>

<h4><a name="7.4.2. Retrieval">7.4.2. Retrieval</a></h4>

<p>This section describes the components and procedures used by Z39.50 to return records
in response to a query.</p>

<h5><a name="7.4.2.1. Schema">7.4.2.1. Schema</a></h5>

<p>The GEO Profile specifies a GEO Schema (see <a href="annex_c.htm">Annex C</a>). The GEO
Schema is a registered object with an OID of {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 13 4}. A schema in
Z39.50 can be modified and may evolve over time, and it is reasonable to expect the GEO
Schema will evolve.</p>

<h5><a name="7.4.2.2. Element Sets">7.4.2.2. Element Sets</a></h5>

<p>GEO servers are required to support three element set names: B (Brief), S (Summary),
and F (Full). GEO servers will interpret the use of the element set names to identify the
following elements from the GEO Schema (marked with their SGML tags in parentheses): 

<ul>
  <li><strong>B</strong>: includes the <a
    HREF="http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata/standard/08.html#Title">Title</a>
    (title) element.</li>
  <li><strong>S</strong>: includes the following elements: <a
    HREF="http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata/standard/08.html#Title">Title</a>
    (title), <a

  <li><strong>F</strong>: contains all elements available in the record. The server should
    include in the retrieved record all of the elements for which there is data available in
    the database record and which can be encoded in the requested record syntax (e.g., some
    types of locally-defined binary data may not be encodable in a USMARC or SUTRS record).</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, servers may support additional element set names, including:

<ul>
  <li><strong>A</strong>: includes the <a
    HREF="http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata/standard/08.html#Title">Title</a>
    (title) and <a
    href="http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/pub/tools/metadata/standard/01.html#Abstract">Abstract</a>
    (abstract) elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>A GEO server is required to return the following diagnostic from the Bib-1 Diagnostic
Set when it receives a request for an element set name that is not supported by the
server: 

<ul>
  <li>Element Set Name Not Valid (25)</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="7.4.2.3. Record Syntaxes">7.4.2.3. Record Syntaxes</a></h5>

<p>The GEO Profile requires support for the following Record Syntaxes: 

<ul>
  <li>GRS-1 {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 5 105}: GRS-1 can be used to encapsulate more complex
    bundles of information including images, related documents, video, or other ancillary
    information for further processing by the client. GRS-1 could also be used to encapsulate an
    Entry in SGML along with the reference to -- or even inclusion of -- a DTD. GRS-1 is
    defined in Z39.50-1995 <a href="#[1]">[1]</a>.</li>
  <li>HTML {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 5 109 3}: HTML is used to obtain a GEO Entry that is
    formatted by the server for eventual display by a Web Browser. The specification for HTML
    is maintained by <a href="#[8]">[8]</a>.</li>
  <li>SUTRS {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 5 101}: SUTRS is used to display a GEO Entry in simple text.
    SUTRS is defined in Z39.50-1995 <a href="#[1]">[1]</a>.</li>
  <li>XML {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 5 109 10}: XML can be used to exchange GEO Entries between
    servers or for loading into a metadata editor or presentation system for further
    processing. The XML Document Type Definition (DTD) is included in <a href="annex_c.htm">Annex
    C</a>. The specification for XML is maintained by <a href="#[8]">[8]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For GEO Entries in HTML and SUTRS Record Syntaxes, it is recommended that GEO servers
follow the guidelines outlined for the <a href="#7.5. Preferred Display Format">preferred
display format</a>. HTML is the default Record Syntax to return when the client has not
specified a preferred record syntax.</p>

<p>For purposes of interoperability, servers may support other record syntaxes including: 

<ul>
  <li>SGML {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 5 109 9}: SGML can be used to exchange GEO Entries between
    servers or for loading into a metadata editor or presentation system for further
    processing. The SGML DTD is included in <a href="annex_c.htm">Annex C</a>.</li>
  <li>USMARC {ANSI-standard-Z39.50 5 10}: The element of a GEO Entry can be mapped into USMARC
    <a href="#[6]">[6]</a> using a formal mapping of the FGDC Content Standards for Digital
    Geospatial Metadata to USMARC <a href="#[9]">[9]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a GEO-conformant server is unable to return a record in the requested record
syntax, the server should return an appropriate diagnostic from the Bib-1 Diagnostic Set,
such as: 

<ul>
  <li>Record Not Available in Requested Syntax (238)</li>
  <li>Record Syntax Not Supported (239)</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="7.5. Preferred Display Format">7.5. Preferred Display Format</a></h3>

<p>The GEO Profile recommends a preferred display format for the mandatory record
syntaxes, HTML and SUTRS. A GEO Entry should be displayed in an indented outline form with
subordinate elements indented to the appropriate level of subordination. The default
presentation format shall use the long element names as specified in <a href="annex_d.htm">Annex
D</a>, followed by a colon and a space with the value of the element on one or more lines.
At least one character indentation shall exist for dependent or subordinate elements.</p>

<p>A GEO Entry in HTML may be encapsulated between &lt;PRE&gt; &lt;/PRE&gt; tags or may
include local hypertext links to aid navigation of the metadata document. </p>

<h3><a name="7.6. Diagnostic Messages">7.6. Diagnostic Messages</a></h3>

<p>The GEO application will use the Bib-1 Diagnostic Set.</p>
