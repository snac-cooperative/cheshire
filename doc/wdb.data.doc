Overview
========

     This file documents the data structure used in WDB-II.  It
     is from the original MS-DOS version by Fred Pospeschil and
     Antonio Riveria.  Note that in this distribution for the
     Amiga, the data appears in a different form than the original
     in several respects:

     First, the original data was in Intel low order - high order
     format.  For this release the data has been converted for use
     with the Motorola chip set (high order - low order).

     Second, individual groupings of data for coastlines, islands,
     rivers, lakes, and political boundaries as they appeared in
     the original, have been consolidated into WDB.?.ALL files
     consisting of data from all 6 groups.

     And lastly, the largest of the original data files did not
     contain any data points from the lesser files; the complete
     data set was only available by summing the data from each of
     five detail levels.  This release differs in that the largest
     file now contains all data, including that from each of the
     lower four detail levels.  Each of the lower level files is a
     subset of The Big File and, indeed, each lower level data
     file is a subset of all higher level files.

Micro WDB-II File and Record Structures
=======================================

All Micro WDB-II files are sequential files composed of fixed length
six byte records which can be accessed randomly.  Each record is
composed of three 16-bit signed integer fields which can be read by
all microcomputer languages.  There are no record seperators used in
these files.  The record layout is :

   | Code | Latitude | Longitude |

In Pascal, the record definition is :

POINT = RECORD
CODE      : INTEGER;
LATITUDE  : INTEGER;
LONGITUDE : INTEGER;
   END;

Within the MWDBII files the records are stored as shown below.
In some cases there may be hundreds of points in a single line
segment.  In other cases there may be consecutive header records
which locate individual points to be plotted.

|Header|Point1|Point2|PointN|Header|Point1|Point2|PointN|Header
|Point1|Point2|Header|Header|Header|Point1|Point2|PointN|


The same format is used for both the line header records and
point records.  The usage of each field is as follows :


Field Definitions
=================

CODE - Line Header Records.

The CODE field is used to :

   1.  Identify the type of line segment which is described by
       the point records which follow it,

   2.  Identify the line or point within the line type, and

   3.  Provide the coordinates if the record describes a point.

In header records the CODE field is always a positive four digit
number in the form of : ABBB where

A =                         BBB =           CODE =
  1 = Coast lines         001 -> 208     1001 -> 1208
  2 = Country boundries   001 -> 301     2001 -> 2301
  4 = State boundries     001 -> 111     4001 -> 4111
  5 = Islands             001 -> 344     5001 -> 5344
  6 = Lakes               001 -> 103     6001 -> 6103
  7 = Rivers              001 -> 196     7001 -> 7196


CODE - Point records.

In point records the CODE field contains the detail level.  The
detail level is a value in the range of 1 through 5.  To properly
retrieve points at any detail level use the following comparison :

   IF CODE >= DESIRED_DETAIL_LEVEL THEN ...


LATITUDE and LONGITUDE - In both header and point records.

The latitude and longitude fields contain the coordinate values
expressed in signed minutes.  The values in these fields are computed
with the formula COORD_VALUE := (Degrees * 60) + Minutes.  Thus, the
ranges of coordinate values in MWDBII are :

 90 00N =    5400
 90 00S =   -5400
180 00E =   10800
180 00W =  -10800

MWDBII uses the standard four quadrant cartesian coordinate
system in which north, south, east, and west are referenced to the
equator and the Greenwich meridian.

When a header record is followed by point records the coordinates in
the header record are the beginning of the line.  When a header record
is followed by another header record then the coordinates in the
header record should be plotted as a single point. When working at low
levels of detail it is common to find multiple consecutive header
records which locate isolated points.  There may also be gaps between
some of the lines.
