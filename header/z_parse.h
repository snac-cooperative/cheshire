*       Header Name:    z_parse.h
*
*       Programmer:     Ray Larson
*
*       Purpose:        Data structures for HOST and INDEX tables in
*                       CHESHIRE II -- used for Z39.50 & query parsing.
*
*       NOTE: Currently the highest value supported in the internal
*             representation for USE attributes in cheshire.h is 9600
*             This can be extended if needed, but will require recompiling
*             everything.
