His effect is continous, constantly resetting his Province's strength to the lowest of any in the game as long as he's in the battle. Effects that raise Province strength will be immediately overridden (though they will be seen if Damesh is killed or removed from the battle, raising Province strength as they normally would have). Effects that reduce Province strength will have full effect since it will still be the lowest of any in play.

Ability is not usable if you do not have a chance to perform Open or Battle actions (e.g., Crushing Attack).

Being bowed does not stop a card from adding its Chi to the army.
Honor losses you cannot suffer never exist. They cannot be modified before the Stronghold negates them.
Another player can modify losses you cause yourself, or redirect an honor loss that you inflicted on him or her back to you.
You lose honor if one of your Ninja personalities dies dishonorably.
Ability bows all cards in attacking units, not just Personalities.

The last player who doesn't send a unit (or the last player who sends the unit with the lowest Force) has his leftmost Province attacked by the Horde. Only the Defender may assign units to defend and perform actions. All Shadowlands cards in the Horde gain 2F. After resolution, the Horde is destroyed.</text>

Counts as an army once assembled.
Forces of individual units are not checked until the Horde is formed.
Horde units removed from the battle return to their controller's Fief.
Sending a unit to the Horde is not "assigning" it. [Card text] Units that have restrictions on attacking can be sent freely.
Cannot be prevented by cards that prevent declarations of attack (e.g., Emperor's Peace), assignment (e.g., Ki-Rin), or assignment at a particular province (e.g., Clan Heartland).

His extra focus happens "before the duel.":
1. Because focus cards add to Chi as soon as they're played, he does not die instantly if he uses his ability with an attached Tetsubo, provided he takes his free first focus and plays a card with a focus value greater than 0.
2. Reactions to entering a duel occur after this focus

Focusing two cards can be combined with an effect that provides a Focus for the duel, even if that Focus is worded as occuring before the duel (e.g., Oracle of Fire).
If Uso focuses a card from somewhere other than your hand, the other card must come from your hand.

She can assign by herself. There does not need to be an army already present for her to "join."
Her presence in an army will not change your overall role (Attacker/Defender/ally) in the attack. You also are not considered an ally if you assign her where you are not invited.
Putting her in the other army will not allow you to take battle actions twice as often.
Cannot assign if there is no attack.
Units and effects (including Way of Deception) that do not break normal presence-in-battle rules cannot be used to swap with her or move in to join her.
The clause, "You never gain Honor when Ogoku joins an army," refers to the 2 point gain for allying

1. With Night of a Thousand Fires, you would still need to bow a ninja as well as the kiho's caster.
2. With Kolat Master, you would not need to spend 10G but you would lose 4 honor.
3. With the Egg of P'an Ku, you may have more than one Egg in play provided no more than one has the Unique trait, whether by being the actual Egg of P'an Ku card or by being a copy of a Unique Personality.
When copying from a card with more than one action on it, one must be choosen when the original Path Not Taken is cast.
May be used if you forced your opponent to discard, even if the discard is from a deck, not the Fate hand.

Any player unable to win an Honor Victory must destroy a Province to this event. Any player who can win an Honor Victory can renounce it to spare a Province, even if he is a clan listed on the event.
Does not destroy a player's Province if:

o There are additional conditions for achieving an Honor Victory (e.g., Kisada's Funeral)
A player must react with Defenders of the Realm immediately after "All players have their rightmost Province destroyed." If played, no one loses a Province and no one can give up their honor victory to avoid losing a Province.

  <text type = "flavour"></text>
  <text type = "errata">
When producing 7G, the shugenja does not gain the Shadowlands trait until he or she enters play.
Producing 7G for an originally non-Shadowlands shugenja counts as "bringing a Shadowlands card into play."
Effects that alter the gold production of strongholds alter only the basic "3" on the box and do not affect the amounts its traits produce.
Effects that do not refer to gold production, but to, e.g., the amount of gold produced "when a stronghold is bowing to pay for a personality" will affect the stronghold's trait of paying extra gold for spells and shugenja.

Should read, "... voluntarily changed." Prevents effects that would make any aspect of honor gain / loss different from what would happen if it were allowed to occur with no voluntary interference. Thus:
1. Prevents effects occurring after the honor gain or loss, including any and all Reactions triggered by an honor gain or loss (e.g., Hantei Naseru).
2. Does not prevent ongoing effects which change honor losses automatically (e.g., Deeds, Not Words).

You can take actions that might cause an honor loss (e.g., Iaijutsu Challenge). Treat "would" as "will."

 Foregoing honor gain is a cost of using his ability. Copies of his ability cannot be used to gain multiple bonuses on the same samurai, because you can only forgo the honor gain once.
If you're buying a 0PH Samurai at full price, there is still a zero point honor gain. It can be foregone once to pay for Gaijutsu's ability.
Ability is Political.
