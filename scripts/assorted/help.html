Cheshire II provides a uniform interface for accessing a number of
catalogs and other information sources.  It does this through its
implementation of the Z39.50 client/server protocol.  One of its
advantages is that if you don't find what you are looking for at one
site, you only need to select a different host and press the Start
Search button again to look for the same item(s) elsewhere.  (On the
downside, this feature restricts the WWW version of Cheshire II to
offering only those indices known to be supported on all hosts,
namely, author, title, and subject/topic.)

<P>Less obvious, but more exciting, is the availability of ranked
retrieval, which permits one to enter terms that may not exactly match
those in any particular index and still retrieve highly relevant
materials.  This is only available at the "UCB Physical Sciences" site
and the "UC Berkeley Digital Library" site,
which use the Cheshire II server and search engine.

<P>Even less obvious is the recent addition of various servers
accessed via the Digital Library InfoBus (a CORBA-based digital
information sharing architecture) through a Z39.50 proxy. These
are indicated in the information services menu as "InfoBus access
to xxx" for a variety of different services. The InfoBus Z39.50
proxy at Stanford sends back the results of searches in a simplified
MARC format.
 
<P>Least obvious of all is the fact that the bibliographic records
housed on the Cheshire II server are in SGML format.  While you will
see no difference between these and the standard MARC format records
provided by the other hosts on the menu, Cheshire II's use of SGML
means that in the future, Cheshire searches will be able locate and
deliver all sorts of documents, and not just bibliographic records.

While the number of Z39.50 complient servers is increasing rapidly,
only about a dozen of these are on the list of catalogs available for
searching via the Cheshire II interface.  They are sites judged to be
of potential interest to UC users , which also happen to be regularly
accessible and well-behaved.

<P>The list currently includes the <A HREF="http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/">
UC Berkeley NSF/NASA/ARPA Digital Library </a> 
of full-text environmental documents. The

National Newspaper Index</A> -- which can only be accessed from Berkeley
campus computers. (The preceding periodical index links lead to short
descriptions of the databases in question and, indirectly, to 
detailed instructions for accessing them through MELVYL.  These
contain potentially useful information for the Web Cheshire user, even
though specific command sequences and the like will not apply.)

<P>When you retrieve records from one of these hosts, you have the
option of clicking an author name or subject heading to get 10 more
items by the same person or on the same topic.  When you do, these
will be retrieved from the same host as the original record set, even
if you have changed hosts on the main search screen in the meantime.
(If you want or need more than 10 items, click the button at the
bottom of the record display to get 10 more; or return to the main
screen, type in the author or subject, and ask for as many as you
wish.)

<H3><A NAME="IND">Indexes</H3></A>

Using the familiar Web browser to access diverse information resources
is clearly advantageous, but it imposes limitations as well, one of
which is that only those indexes supported by all hosts can appear in
the lists of choices.

<P>Cheshire's non-WWW interface does not have this problem, since it
adjusts index lists whenever the user chooses a new host; but HTML
forms do not currently support this sort of interaction.  It is
possible that incorporating Java into Web Cheshire will eliminate this
limitation, but it has not yet been tried.  In the meantime, hosts
accessible through Web Cheshire can only be searched by author, title,
and subject or topic. (See below for more information on these last
two.)

<P>While most of the index selections available on the WWW version of
Cheshire II will be familiar to users of online catalogs, it is worth
remembering that these are not treated in exactly the same way
everywhere.  For example, some treat title or subject search terms as
keywords and will return any item in which those terms occur in the
appropriate fields.  Duke University's catalog treats them as a
phrase, however.  That is, a title search for <I>endangered
wetlands</I> will only return items in which those to words occur
adjacent to one another in the title.  <I>Wetlands: Endangered
Habitats</I> won't be found.

<P>As a further example, the CIA World Fact Book will get what you
want if you submit the "Algeria" as a topic, author, LC subject
heading, or title; but in all but the last instance you also get data
on the Cape Verde Islands, the Central African Republic, and other
countries.

<P><I>Topic</I> will be the one unfamiliar index.  When you submit a
topic search to the UCB Astr-Math-Stat (that is, the Cheshire server
itself), the search engine looks in several places for terms similar
to those entered, computes the degree of match, and returns a
relevance-ranked list of items.  Where this kind of sophisticated
searching is not supported (that is, everywhere else), but multi-index
exact-match searches are, the latter is used.  In the remaining cases
a standard search is performed against the Library of Congress (LC)
subject heading index.

<P>Needless to say, Cheshire's judgment of relevance will not always
coincide with its user's, but you should generally find some useful
items among the top ranked retrievals; so topic searching "UCB
Astr-Math-Stat" is a good way to begin looking for materials in an
unfamiliar field of inquiry.  (To get a sense of this do a topic
search for "local compactness."  The top ranked retrievals are clearly
relevant, despite the fact that the terms <I>local</I> and
<I>compactness</I> don't appear.  Title and subject searches for
"local compactness" in Melvyl, for example, find nothing.) Avoid topic
searches that include common terms -- like "astronomy" or "algebra" --
or terms that have multiple meanings, however, as these frequently
lead to disappointing results.

<P>Most servers allow one to narrow or broaden your search by choosing
to "and" or "or" search terms (by means of the buttons directly above
the search entry windows).  There are exceptions, however.  The Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology catalog permits only
single-index searches.

<H3><A NAME="ITE">Number of Items to Retrieve</H3></A>

It is usually a good idea to request a relatively small number of
items to retrieve when you begin a search.  This will enable you to
determine if you are on the right track, or if you should change your
strategy, without waiting for hundreds of records to be transmitted
from the selected host.  If you ask to retrieve only 10, say, they
seem to be just what you are looking for, and the search results
screen says that there are 50 more, you can either get them 10 at a
time by clicking the "Next" button at the bottom of the record
display; go back to the main search screen, change the number to
retrieve to 60, and resubmit the search; set the starting record to
11, change the number to retrieve to 20, to see records 11 thru 30;
and so on. On the other hand, if the results screen says that there
are 500 more, you should probably concoct a new search.

<P>If you just want to know how many items are available at a site,
you can set the number to retrieve to 0 or, equivalently, put nothing
in the window at all. (Putting nothing in the starting record window,
however, is considered to be a request to begin the display with
record number 1.)

<H3><A NAME="FMT">Display Formats</H3></A>

You may want to select the short, rather than the (default) long,
display format you can reduce the number of screens you need to page
through to review your search results.  If you are happy with the
results, but want to see more information about the items, you must go
back to the search screen and resubmit your search after selecting the
long format.  At the moment, the results of searches submitted by
clicking an author or subject hot-link are available in long format
only.

<P>If you are searching one of periodical indexes, however, you may
well want to use the long display format from the start, since it will
include article abstracts if they are available, while the short
display format will suppress them.

<H3><A NAME="NUL">Null Retrievals</H3></A>

It sometimes happens that you submit a search, but get nothing back.
Any number of things may be the cause: The source you are checking may
simply not have anything matching the description you gave.  The
selected host may be down temporarily and not accepting requests; it
may be refusing to service your search because it contains very common
words and would tie up the machinery for an unacceptably long time; or
something may have gone awry with the Z39.50 exchange between the
client and server.  There may be a misspelling in your search request.
Or you may have encountered a Cheshire bug as yet undetected by its
creators.

<P>Cheshire tries to distinguish among these and displays diagnostic
messages when it can, some of which may be cryptic.  Efforts are
underway to clarify the diagnostic messages, to provide diagnostics
where none exist, and to sort out all the error codes returned by the
various servers Cheshire communicates with.

<OL> <LI>Clicking some <b>hot-links that contain numbers or certain
punctuation</b> marks can produce null retrievals, apparently because
the host is unable to process them in a search requests.  These
problems are being addressed as they come to light.<P>

<LI>Subject (and probably other) , <B>searches containing
punctuation</B> -- e.g. "c*-algebras" -- will not be exactly
matched in the UCB Physical Sciences database
Removing the punctuation to get "c algebras" and using the
"subject" instead of "topic" index will get the desired results<p>
