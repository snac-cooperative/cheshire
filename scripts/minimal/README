This is a simple script to delete all of the database config files,
test records and other assorted files in the CVS tree used for testing
or building with dmalloc.
Run it in the top cheshire directory (Where the Makefiles are) and
then replace the Makefile with the one in this directory.  It assumes
you have Berkeley db 3.3 installed in an accessable linking path.
