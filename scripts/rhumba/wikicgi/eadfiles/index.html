This is an EAD Cheshire Wiki. 
<p>
In theory you should be able to add EAD records via the Template, Edit them,
and view them with a static URL.
<p>
Here are some instructions: <a href = "instructions.html">Instructions</a>
<p>
Here's a record: <a href= "eadrec.html">Ead Record</a>
<p>
Here are my initial notes on WIKI design: <a href = "/~cheshire/wiki/notes.html">Notes</a> and <a href = "/~cheshire/wiki/">Here</a> is the HTML cheshire Wiki.
<p>
Searching should be possible as well, but integration of eadsearch and wiki is tricky.
