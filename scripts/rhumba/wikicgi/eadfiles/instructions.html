<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
EAD Wiki is a system to allow online creation and editing of EAD records, using both full SGML editing and an ISAD(G) style template.  Record metadata is recorded, as is information as to who is permitted to edit each record.
<p>
<b>Viewing Records</b>
<p>
Type in the URL of the location of the record that you wish to see.  In the future there will be facilities to search for individual records and browse the existing records. For the moment, write down the location of each record that you create.
<p>
<b>Editing a Record</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>To edit a record, you need to call it up in HTML first as above. 
<li>At the bottom of the page will be a button called 'Edit', click on this.  
<li>A window will appear asking for a name and password and you need to type these in.
<li>A selection of commands will appear, ensure that 'edit record' is selected and click submit
<li>The template will appear, with the values filled in. Edit these entries and click Render to SGML at the bottom of the file.
<li>A second window will appear. The EAD record will be inside a box, which can be further edited if desired.
<li>When the record is updated, click on the Save button.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Creating a New Record</b>
<p>
Currently Creating a new record directly from a location doesn't work fully. Instead take an existing record and copy it to a new location, then edit it from there.
<br>To do this:
<ul>
<li>Call up the record in HTML
<li>Click the Edit button
<li>Select 'Copy' from the list of options
<li>A form will appear, select a new location and identifier. The location is where the record will be, the ID is to keep the record distinct from any other record. When you have filled these out, click Submit and the record will be copied.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Error Messages</b>
<p>
There are several error messages that may appear. For example you cannot copy a record over an existing one. In these cases, you'll be prompted to fill out the form again.
