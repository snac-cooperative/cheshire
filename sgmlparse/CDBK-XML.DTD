<!-- Version history:

     1.0             Includes PFS-authored sections only.
     1.1   19.4.96   Incorporates NANMV-authored sections.
     1.1a  22.4.96   Addition of ATTLISTs to NANMV sections
		     and general cleanup, in progress.
		     Leading to:
     1.2   23.4.96   First version that pretends to
		     completeness.
     1.3   21.5.96   Incorporates 3/96-4/96 changes
		     in descriptions.
     1.4   29.5.96   Incorporates 5/96 changes
		     in descriptions except header.
     1.4a   7.6.96   Minor repairs.
     1.5   11.7.96   Further minor repairs occasioned by
		     conversion to parameter-entity file
		     (teicb1.dtd, version 1.5).
     1.6	Modified by Daniel Pitti, UC Berkeley, Library.
            Provided value "PCDATA" for TEI parameter entities
	      to make it possible to parse and test the DTD.
            Parsed with NSGMLS and Near&Far
     1.6X	Modified by Jan Nielsen (JN), Danish Data Archives.
            Modifications in several places to produce a
            version compliant with the W3C XML version 1.0
            proposal of December 8th 1997. Parsed and tested
            with Microsofts Java parser MSXML (ver. 1.0.8).
            The XML 1.0 specification used is available at
            http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-xml-971208.
            - and-connectors have been replaced by
              sequence-connectors. The order of
              elements is unchanged.
            - tag-minimisation parameters have been
              removed.
            - Parameter entity references without
              semicolons have been fixed.
            - Name groups are avoided by expansion
              of element and attribute declarations.
            - Element inclusions have been discarded.
            - Attribute default values have been quoted.
            - NUMBER data type have been replaced by CDATA
              in attribute values.

<!-- Working assumption is that cb.dtd will be used in
     conjunction with the TEI.dtd as a so-called "base tag
     set." It is not yet decided whether this base tag set
     should invoke the default text structure, as most but
     not all such sets do. Codebooks could be tagged using
     a combination of the (largely informational rather
     than structural) tags supplied here, plus the low-level
     structural and presentational elements of the TEI core
     tag set, plus the additional tags included in the TEI
     "figures and graphs" additional tag set                 -->

<!-- Actual inclusion as a base tag set requires that the
     standard element declarations given in this document
     be converted into parameter entity stand-ins, so that
     (e.g.) element "stat" is represented by entity "%n.stat;".
     The product of this conversion will be updated in parallel
     with this document, and is to be found in the file
     "teicb1.dtd."                                           -->

<!-- In anticipation of use as a TEI base tag set, most elements
     declared here have been given the TEI global attributes
     using the TEI parameter entity %a.global in their
     ATTLISTs. The global attributes are N (name or number),
     ID (id), LANG (language), and REND (rendering)          -->

<!-- Provisionally, TEI low-level elements have been added
     via use of the standard TEI content model parameter
     entities "%phrase.seq," "%paraContent," and "%specialPara."
     At a later point it may prove necessary to
     abandon these in favor of a more customized approach,
     perhaps via selective "inclusions" or customized parameter
     entities created from sub-sets of the TEI low-level elements.
							     -->
<!-- Initial working policy  has been to include TEI
     in the contents of only the lowest codebook elements,
     so that, for example, the data distribution statement
     may contain *only* codebook elements (such as data
     distributor or depositor), but those lower-level codebook
     elements may contain broth, soup, or chunks (to use
     the TEI metaphors): paragraphs, lists, names, addresses,
     abbreviations, etc. Since it is to be expected that real
     distribution statements will contain other matter than
     that designated by the the available codebook tags, it
     will have to be decided: do we allow soup at the higher
     levels? Or do we define the lower-level elements broadly
     enough that they include all possible contents? Or do
     we, in encoding an existing codebook, simply delete material
     that doesn't fit into the codebook tags? A fourth
     alternative still is to include an "otherMat" tag
     at every level.                                         -->

<!-- The version of TEI intended to be used with this
     DTD is further modified by the small alterations
     to the TEI element content models, especially to
     those used in the TEI header, so as to produce
     a distinctively codebook/TEI header. Those changes,
     implemented via the standard TEI modification
     mechanisms, are not not documented in this file.

         or <STDYDSCR XML:LANG="EN-gb">.
         This may imply that the use of the TEI entity
         a.global is not necessary in the XML version
         (unless we still want the N and REND attributes).
         As the language problem is taken care of by XML

<!-- NOTE that I have made these repeatable, in agreement with
     the consensus of the last committee meeting, despite the
     instruction that they not be (except the last which
     was allowed to be). I have done this on the assumption
     that these elements are descriptive of the informational
     hierarchy of the document, not of the physical arrangement.
     That is, one has to be prepared for a situation in which
     (say) pieces of study description are physically followed
     by the data files description, after which the study
     description resumes, or in which irrelevant "other"
     documentation interrupts the data description or
     methodology (a bibliography placed in the middle of
     a methodological description, for example). The easiest
     way to handle these situations would seem to be to allow
     the elements to be repeatable. (Is there a better way? )
     I have tried to push all elements dealing with physical
     arrangement to the lowest level of the structure, but
     have not yet (as indicated above) squared this with the
     physically-oriented default text structure (text-front-
     body-div-back) of TEI. The only potential problem with
     repeatability involves information that is repeated in
     different forms (e.g. several items claiming to be the
     title) with no indication of which is the forma citanda.
     Most of these problems are irrelevant if a full TEI
     header is supplied.                                     -->

     various existing orderings, and perhaps a wider variety of

     should not be handled by a single repeatable "title"
     (titl) tag, with a type attribute that could be set
     to "sub" or "common" or "parallel." (Nor any reason that
     the TEI title tag itself could not be used,
     if not already included by invocation of TEI bibliographic
     tags at a higher level, as it is in the codebook header).
     "Common abbreviation," i.e., a common abbreviation of the
     title, deserves to be treated in the same way with the
     type attribute set = abbr. My preferred rendering  thus

     elements do not, however, possess a 'type' attribute:
     in order to mark various dates as being "beginning
     date of collection," etc., some other expedient will
     have to be employed: most easily, modify the TEI date
     element to include a "type" or "event" attribute. Or,
     of course, create separate tags for each possible kind
     of date. The next element seems to be directed toward
     that end. Accordingly, I have allowed collDate to
